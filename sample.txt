Jimi Hendrix is arguably the greatest and most influential guitarist in the history of rock. There are thousands of Jimi Hendrix wannabe's. This article will help you to play guitar like Jimi. It covers both the specific techniques he used and the spirit of his music.

Method
1
Selecting The Right Equipment
1
Do your research! If you are truly striving for classic rock'n'roll sound, it takes research. Lots of research. There are a lot of resources on the internet that can tell you exactly what equipment was used and because of today's high technology, there are pedals and computer programs that can take a music file and process it to sound like the original riff.
To find out about guitars from the experts, go to a guitar show. Most cities have one (or even two) each year. You can have all of your questions answered there and see and test out hundreds of types of guitars to find the best fit for you.
When you really want a sound from before the 1980s, remember the equipment was different. Sound systems were not as clear and amps had tubes in the brain. Modern technology has advantages over old equipment by reliability and reduced weight, but the sound is sacrificed. You can come pretty close with the use of pedals and a great sound man, so you don't need a wall of amps or full band anymore.
2
Consider the limits of the sound quality produced by the equipment being purchased. Guitar legends depend on their amps and equipment, as much as their guitar, for their sound. Face it, you're not gonna get The Who's wall of sound from a single small portable amp. There is a very small battery powered amp that clips to your belt so you can walk around playing through headsets.
3
Purchase the correct guitar. You will need a guitar, but not just any guitar. Get a guitar within a price range of $100 and $500. Anything less than that will produce poor sound and make playing difficult. Guitars like these are destined to collect dust in the corners of a kid's room. Go to a place such as Sam Ash or Guitar Center, where they will let you play their guitars until you find one that's perfect for you.
Hendrix himself played a Fender Stratocaster. If you want to sound similar to him, purchase the guitar of that brand.
4
Purchase the accessories for the guitar. Although Hendrix was most often known for the right-handed Fender Stratocaster played upside-down, 100-watt Marshalls, and lots of pedals, it is not at all necessary for one to clone this set-up. If one has played electric for any time at all, they should have learned that one's sound is everything from the type of picks, strings, pickups, cords, pedals, amps, tubes, speakers, and cabinets, any one of which can have a profound impact on getting you where you want to be.
Find the correct tuner. There is a lot to choose from and they are easy to use. For about $10 a clip-on will be everything you'll ever need. They are small and easy to take along with you. A tuner saves a lot of time and gets you playing fast. With a clip-on, leave it clipped to the top of the guitar. You'll use it every time you play. No, it won't hurt the guitar neck.
Get a guitar stand that is easy to fold up, carry around and set up. Take it everywhere.
Shop around to find the most comfortable guitar strap (maybe two, they're cheap!) These should wide enough to distribute the weight of the guitar across your shoulders.
Get a case. One with a hard shell is great but a soft knit bag is fine. The guitar will be dry, cool, and it keeps dents and scratches to a minimum. Remember, every scratch will be there forever.
Guitar picks are optional . The best advice is to find the weight pick that's comfortable in your hand and get a whole bunch. Not sure what feels right? Go to a guitar show and people will give you lots of free picks. Experiment and keep the ones you like. Give away the ones you don't and other players will think you're a nice guy! You don't always have to play with a pick, but have 'em around just in case.
Get a good Marshall amp head with two speakers (cabinets) underneath it. This is referred to as a 'Marshall Full Stack'. Getting an old Marshall that uses tubes will sound most like Jimi's, but they cost more. If you can't afford a Marshall, any other amp will be good enough. Or just get a good cheaper amp, maybe a Fender.
Get a Wah Pedaland a Distortion Pedal which are required if learning Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)' is desired. This can be purchased later as your playing skill become advanced.

Practicing the Basics of the Guitar Playing
1
Take some lessons in guitar playing. Before you master a legend like Hendrix you must be well acquainted with some basic guitar skills. This will make it easier to go along. Rather you are holding a guitar for the very first time or a seasoned pro. Lessons and practice are always a great way to get started or refreshed on the proper techniques and new technology and advances of this interest or hobby. Different people learn things better in different formats. Some learn better with a book and chart, others learn better with visuals like videos on the web and DVDs. Still, others learn better enrolling in a class with an actual instructor. Find the learning format that best suits you.
Make sure the courses or materials you get involved in or purchase for the lessons are relevant and accurate. Some "courses" are actually non-existing and may be scam. Not all up to date books on guitars are really accurate and are just repeats of older books.This also applies to websites and Youtube videos be careful.
It really doesn't matter if the person on the video is a music legend or not. As long as the music note lessons are correct and the sound is equal to Jimi Hendrix.
Make sure you also get chord charts that are available in many music stores or download them from websites. These are really handy for memorizing chords and notes.
2
Start learning the basic guitar chords and scales. This will give you the basic knowledge of the instrument. An instructor could help too, but Jimi didn't have one (but then again, at first he didn't have a real guitar either). Whenever starting a new craft or interest it's always a great idea to learn the rules and basics first. Once you know the rules you can break and bend them as many artists do after learning them.
3
Practice and improvise constantly! This is how Jimi got his solos. Make sure you learn blues scales to improvise on. Elvis, B.B. King, and Muddy Waters were Jimi's influences. So listen to these and other styles of music as well. It's going to feel frustrating, but if Jimi taught us one thing, it's to never give up.

Taking Inspiration from Rock and Roll History
1
Take hints from the truly great guitar players of years past. Yes, they learned a few things from other players, maybe took a few lessons, but the greats broke away from the herd and took music into their own hands. When you think about many artists using any media or art form in one way or another somehow got inspired by another artist who did the same thing. Read or watch biographies of artists that interest you. You don't have to just stick to Hendrix.
2
Inspire yourself with the life story of Jimi Hendrix himself. Hendrix began playing guitar at 15, played music around Tennessee but found fame playing in England. He only played electric guitar and experimented with the sound. Before him, even though electric guitars had been around since 1931, they were playing the same as an acoustic. Where most musicians simply amplified what they played, Hendrix used feedback, bending strings and percussion noises on the solid body guitar during his performances to distort and enhance the usual string sound. Every time he played live, the sound was different. His career spanned only four years, but he is still considered the most influential electric guitarist in the history of rock music.
3
Think of the crafty Robert Johnson who combined different playing styles into an original style all his own. This guy is the legendary guitarist who people say sold his soul at the crossroads to the devil for the special guitar licks that no one can duplicate. The story goes that he learned a few things from other players, disappeared for a while, then suddenly reappeared playing a one of a kind style. He recorded 29 songs in a room at the Baker Hotel in Dallas, TX, in 1937, and every rock and roll (and blues) song is an extension of his work.
4
Motivate yourself with the story of Jimmy Page as inspiration when you get bored of learning basic notes and chords. He started off learning a few chords from a friend, got bored and taught himself to play by listening to records. He began live performances at 13, did studio session work for years, was a member of The Yardbirds, and by 26 had formed Led Zeppelin. Most of the recorded guitar solos from 1960 to 1968 in England were played by him, including work with The Who, The Kinks, Herman's Hermits and The Rolling Stones.

Mastering Jimi Hendrix's Guitar Holding Technique
1
Remember Hendrix had a unique anatomy that allowed him to play the guitar in a unique way. He had extremely large hands with long fingers. This allowed him to do some things that just cannot be imitated by all (example: he could wrap his right thumb {he was left hand dominant, so his right hand played the fret board} around the top of the neck and play the two low strings such as low E and A two frets below his first finger. This allowed him to play dominant 7 barre (or bar-) chords with a 7th and 3rd in the bass (as opposed to the typical 1 and 5, or "power chord" .
Look at a more Conventional Barre Chord. Use the photographs to compare the Conventional Barre Chord to A La Jimi Chord. The first photo is the Conventional Chord which is a Barre Chord that most guitarists first learn.
Now examine the A La Jimi Chord. This second photo is the Hendrix aka A La Jimi Hendrix Chord was a not a Conventional Barre Chord. Notice the different hand and finger positions.
A note on left-hand technique: normally it would be a terrible technique for the wrist to be collapsed against the neck like this. Frankly doing it too often or in an unrelaxed manner is a great way to get carpal tunnel syndrome. But call this is an ‘advanced technique,’ and Hendrix himself had huge hands with long fingers. One does not need to play the 'Hendrix way' to sound very very close to the real thing. In general, the wrist should be straight, with the thumb gently against the neck allowing you to squeeze and also one rotates on the thumb like it’s a lever when doing vibrato.
2
Learn Jimi Hendrix unique "guitaristic" move. He invented his own unique, highly "guitaristic" move whereby he placed his first finger on the first fret of the 2nd string, third finger on the third fret of the 4th, and fourth finger on the third fret of the 1st string, then played these, along with the open 3rd string, and rapidly slide this finger formation up and down. This can be heard in parts of 'Watchtower,' 'Castles Made of Sand,' among other places. (the Whole move with variations could be diagrammed with tablature).
3
Practice learning the notes while learning the Hendrix Chords. Use tablature or whatever means, and than play them the best you can according to your own gifts. Familiarizing oneself in the blues, esp. delta (Robert Johnson) and Chicago (Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Magic Sam) styles, can help too.
Method
5
Practicing some of Jimi Hendrix's Specific Chords
1
Learn the characteristics of the " Hendrix Chord" which really refers to a couple things. Primarily it's a dominant 7 with a #9 in a particular shape - and in particular the E7#9 which among other places is featured heavily in ‘Purple Haze’ (the other 2 chords of the song being the bars as above on 3rd and 5th frets (G and A)).
2
Learn the E7#9 Chord. Notice the two E-strings are played open, resulting in a very ‘guitaristic’ sound. 1st finger fourth string 6th fret; 2nd finger fifth string 7th fret; 3rd finger third string 7th fret; 4th finger second string 8th fret.
3
Learn the other Jimi Chord which Hendrix also played Purple Haze another way.This is sometimes called “The Jimi Hendrix Chord:”E-major in root position. Refer to the photograph.
The 5th string is not strummed. Notice the pinky poised.
Then add the 7 and 9 to the chord:
This is simply an E-major triad, with ‘bluesy' ornaments added in a pinky-finger barre (optional, use the 3rd and 4th finger for each note) on the 1st and 2nd strings. The 7 of an E-chord is the D-note (3rd fret second string), the 9 is the G-note (3rd fret first string).
This formation and ornament can be played anywhere up the neck, but as a bar-chord (see above). Again, in Purple Haze Jimi would wrap his thumb around for the bass on the 6th string (functioning as the nut does in open position) while muffling or not strumming the 5th string.
Another chord and sound particularly associated with Hendrix which some call ’the Hendrix chord’ - featured very prominently in the sliding chords which open and close ‘Castles Made of Sand.’
As in ‘Castles,’ the first chord is a Gadd9 (also called ‘Gsus2' in poor rock and roll music theory) at the 3th fret (actual first chord is debatable because the maneuver is faded in, but the home key is G): 1st finger second string 3th fret; 3rd finger fourth string 5th fret; 4th finger first string 5th fret; note: second finger does not feature here (some people online think otherwise), and the third string is played open, requiring the 3rd finger to be rather arched.
Jimi slides this formation up and down the neck, always with the 3rd string remaining open. This provides a drone effect which, along with the interval of a 5th in the two highest strings, can be considered alternatively ’psychedelic’ or, in musicological terms, East Indian in flavor (the Beatles’ encounter with Indian music and spirituality made this a popular thing at the time).

Getting to Know How Hendrix Stylized his Music
1
Innovate. Jimi used studio tools to great effect. He was constantly innovating because, as he put it, the "sounds in his head" could not be reproduced until he or his friends came up with a new technique. Many now standard electric guitar effects can be traced back to Jimi: e.g. wah-wah (foot pedal allowing rapid extreme alterations in tone). The famous slide guitar with heavy echo/reverb solo from 'All Along the Watchtower' was created by Jimi using a Zippo cigarette lighter on its side.
He also experimented and tried new techniques with different models of guitars as well. Firstly, he was left-handed but he took a right-handed guitar and turned it upside down after re-stringing the guitar from the low to high E-string. Right-handed guitarist can do this by getting a voodoo Stratocaster or re-stringing like Hendrix. Also, play around with the setting on your amp. Look around for other effects he used on his guitar. Finally, Hendrix usually thumbs his bass note whilst using his other fingers for the rhythm, slides his thumb along the string and heavily uses his whammy bar.
2
Hendrix was a "stylist" in every sense of the word. He started out learning his licks from the players that he admired, then strived to reach into his soul and apply these lessons to create a sound that was Jimi.
Jimi Hendrix never used to play that cleanly, he would just kinda "Get it done" quite a lazy, but very very talented and unique player. Also, he used a lot of finger picking/ physical picking combination. As in he would pick some strings with his pick, while fingerpicking some other strings to get more noise at once that he liked.
Technically: To learn his licks, there are a number of playback devices available that allow you to slow down any particular musical passage, making it easier to find the individual notes that were played. Please note that Hendrix oftentimes would "slurry" a number of notes together, making it difficult to identify individual notes, but not impossible.
Aesthetically: Once you've found the notes and chords, play along with some of his tunes, to get the feel of them.....then play the tunes on your own. In my opinion, if you can play a smooth, soulful rendition of "Little Wing", you are well on your way.
3
Examine how other artist like Jimi Hendrix use innovation to overcome obstacles. Who knows you might learn to play the exact songs as Hendrix with the same notes but in a different technique that better suits your individual circumstances. Aerosmith and Van Halen tune their guitars down 1/2 step. This makes the strings looser and changes the sound. Also, a capo bar changes the tuning by raising all the strings the same step but doesn't make the strings tighter.
Mark Knopfler (formerly of Dire Straits) likes to cap up on the 2nd fret, it raises the bass line and changes the vocals.
Dolly Parton has massive fingernails but still plays guitar -- her guitar is tuned to a G chord so all she has to do is play bar-chords up and down the neck to make a song.

Mastering Jimi Hendrix's Songs
1
Purchase, watch or Download some Jimi Hendrix albums, songs and or videos. Keep these available for reference as you learn to play Hendrix songs and make corrections, innovations, and edits as you go. Often seeking a Jimi Hendrix albums will lead to more discoveries. Some versions of the same song can be harder than other versions. Many sites when your downloading or viewing a video also have notes available in .pdf or Ebook format for downloading.
2
Prepare yourself before playing. Review the steps above to make sure you are doing everything right. It's always a good idea right before playing to review the notes, chords and techniques to make sure you know the right notes and right positions of the fingers. Reviewing the materials will make sure you have all the right accessories ready to go and in good condition.
Have your guitar ready! Inspiration can strike anytime or anywhere. It should be sitting on the stand with the tuner clipped on top. Throw the guitar strap over your shoulder, do a quick tune, strum some chords. Have a guitar chord chart where you can do a quick reference -- back of a bedroom door, inside a cabinet door, inside a closet door, on the back of the front door. A glance can teach you something new.
3
Teach yourself and get it your all. Break out! Sit around with your guitar and experiment. Have a recording device turned on so you can remember what you did. Record everything! Call out what you're doing -- changing tuning, changing equipment, chord names, where your hands are. It will make it easy to duplicate something that sounded good. Otherwise, it could be lost forever. Don't forget to jot things done with pen and paper and to have back up files for song samples just in case the originals get destroyed.
Take breaks often. It's also good to have a drink of water or juice on hand as guitar playing can be strenuous at times like an workout exercise routine. If you fell yourself getting angry and anxious put down the guitar and walk away for a few hours.
4
Learn some of the easier Hendrix songs first. Foxy Lady/Fire are short easy to play. Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),Changes and Purple Haze are the next step requiring the use of the Wah Pedal. These will be pretty easy once you get techniques of the Wah Pedal. Little Wing and Hey Joe have strangely arranged notes. Also these songs are longer and in some parts very fast. All Along The Watchtower is a cover of Bob Dylan which is also pretty easy to learn.
5
Start learning the more advanced Hendrix after you mastered the easier ones. One song If 6 was 9 is pretty easy until the solo starts. Another one Machine Gun is like 20 minutes or more long!

Tips
Or, you could write some of your own music.
Many of Jimi's live solos were improvised, and he was quite free when playing in general. Try varying the original songs and improvising a bit, as Jimi would have.
Get a Wah-Wah pedal once you've got used to his style of playing.
Be sure to learn the E7(#9) chord, dubbed the 'Jimi Hendrix Chord' which he famously used in Purple Haze(1967).

Warnings
Use the whammy bar a lot, but the guitar will go out of tune.
Do not tune the guitar strings higher. You will damage the neck and break strings, and it's very hard on your hands turning practice time into painful healing time. You can loosen the strings 2 or 3 steps, but at some point, they are so loose they buzz on the fret. This is where you experiment to find a balance between loose strings and a capo bar. There are charts and help for tuning to give you a different sound.
Note: Guitars with whammy bars are less likely go out of tune if it is set up properly.
Be careful of your ears and volume. Pete Townshend has a 90% hearing loss. That's fine for him, he never has to play another note in his life. His excuse was standing in front of a wall of amps for years. You, however, should be able to hear the rest of your life.
